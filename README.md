# GreenQuest - Gamified Eco Living

**Tagline**: *Play Green, Live Green!*

## Inspiration
The global climate crisis and a personal journey toward sustainability inspired GreenQuest. The goal: make eco-living fun, accessible, and empowering with AI-driven challenges that blend technology and purpose to shrink carbon footprints.

## What It Does
GreenQuest gamifies sustainability with:
- **AI-personalized eco-challenges** (e.g., reduce energy, recycle).
- **Voice-guided tips** via ElevenLabs for daily eco-advice.
- **Virtual workshops** with Tavus video agents.
- **Blockchain-verified actions** and digital rewards via Algorand.
- **Shareable badges** and leaderboards for viral engagement.
- **Premium subscriptions** (RevenueCat) for advanced challenges and analytics.

## How It Was Built
- **Platform**: Bolt.new for rapid challenge system development.
- **AI**: ElevenLabs for voice interactions, Tavus for video workshops.
- **Monetization**: RevenueCat paywall for premium features.
- **Blockchain**: Algorand for secure eco-action verification and rewards.
- **Backend**: Supabase for scalable auth, storage, and database.
- **Deployment**: Netlify hosting with 'greenquest.app' domain via Entri/IONOS.
